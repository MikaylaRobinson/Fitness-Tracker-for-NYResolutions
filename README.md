# Fitness-Tracker-for-NYResolutions
This is a project to create a fitness/health flask app for my personal use.

# Data Collection
The app itself collects data about my health behaviors. It asks me about my calories, exercise, fitbit steps, and weight. 
The app allows for one entry per day and the data entered into the form is stored in a PostgreSQL database. 

# Future Directions
* The next additions to the app will be formatting (using the currently empy .css file.) The form is currently the standard produced by making a functional app.
* I will also add some form of data visualization as an aide for seeing progress in health changes.
